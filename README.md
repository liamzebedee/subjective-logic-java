# Subjective Logic - Java
Within this repository is contained the source for [this applet](http://folk.uio.no/josang/sl/Op.html) for visualizing subjective logic networks. 

It is my only known copy of any implementation of subjective logic. Decompiled using [Java Decompiler](http://java.decompiler.free.fr/). All code is property of Simon Pope, Shane Hird and Matthew Davey.
